Project Overview

* Utilized DOM methods like getElementById, querySelector, and createElement to cache and manipulate elements dynamically.
* Navigated the DOM using parent-child-sibling relationships and iterated over element collections for efficient manipulation.
* Created dynamic content using DocumentFragment, cloneNode, and appended/prepended new elements to the DOM.
* Implemented event-driven programming with multiple event listeners, modifying HTML, styles, and attributes based on user interaction.
* Developed robust form validation using both HTML attributes and DOM-based validation techniques, ensuring a seamless user experience.
